# Covid-19 Case Predictor
## Project Goals
Implement a machine learning algorithm to predict daily death rate and other relevant statistics caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. I would like to begin in the U.S.A. region, focusing on statistics in each state as well as the country. Additionally, I would like to begin focusing on deaths per day. I currently am currently considering implementing the perceptron algorithm, linear regression, reinforcement learning(although it is semi-supervised) and/or the Kernel methods. The algorithm to be used or developed is currently TBD.

## Tenative Schedule 
Week | Focus | Description
-----|-------|------------
0 -- 9/7 - 9/13|Data Preparation|"Focus on understanding and working with the raw data. Potentially cleansing and extracting data as well. Finalize data to be used in CSV file format. Determine what scripts may be needed as well as what type of scripts (i.e. python, bash). Consider any API’s that may need to be used or created."
1 -- 9/14 - 9/20|Data Preparation(continued)|Potentially create some automation regarding data preparation to help with development time cost. (i.e. a repo downloader with predetermined data cleansing features in mind)
2-- 9/21 - 9/27|Explore and Model data|"Use matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, treeviz, scikit and other python libraries. Determine what ML algorithms like Linear Regression and derivatives can be best to implement for the next few weeks."
3-- 9/28 - 10/4|Compare and Study Algorithms |Create a barebone environment where I can test and benchmark a few algorithms such as but not limited to The Perceptron and linear Regression to help determine what may be most suitable for the end goals.  Learning will be supervised on a window of X amount of days, weeks, months.
4-- 10/5 – 10/11|Compare and Study Algorithms 2|"Determine what algorithm(s) will be used for the project. Determine calculations to be used such as: Death and Recovery percentages, Confidence intervals, Average Error and Norm functions."
5-- 10/12 – 10/18|Implement ML algorithm |"Begin to process data"
6-- 10/19 – 10/25|Implement ML algorithm (Continued)|"Document findings, tweaks and modifications done in detail for future referance. Analyze accuracy of the models and commit."
7 -- 10/26 - 11/1-- Mid-Semester|Create a geographical map with Predictions and other relevant Statistics |"Work with ML algorithm predictions, groom program to be able to use external software such as Tableau. Discover maps in software such as Tableau"
8-- 11/2 - 11/8|Visualize and Store data|"Use matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, treeviz, sklearn and other python libraries. Identify Key aspects in data that can be visualized easiest with the proper tables and graph type. Store data about predicted and target data. To be used to compare model accuracy in following weeks. Continue to work on geographical map configuration and potential API implementations. Consider creating a database to keep from using CSV files raw."
9-- 11/9 - 11/15|Check-in on Project Proposal. qqqAutomation|"Take action where needed to ensure all goals mentioned in project proposal are met. Begin to create a script(s) that can manage ML project independently. Producing daily predictions about COVID-19 statistics. Demonstrate ML algorithms past predictions with the target data. "
10-- 11/16 - 11/22|Construct a Report exhibiting project, goals, challenges and what I was able to learn.|Use professional software such as Tableau to add powerful illustrations for Report’s main discussion points and examples. 
11 -- 11/23 – 11/29-- Thanksgiving Break| Report (countinued) & Wrap-up |"Make final changes on ML algorithm. Ensure total compatibility of scripts with final implementation of each aspect of the project."
12-- 11/30 – 12/6|Last commit on GitHub for all coding related aspects. (continued)|"All scripts must be done by 12/6. Consider packaging the project in a python package executable assuming no necessary bash scripting was used."
13-- 12/7 – 12/13|Final Report Edit|Paper has returned by reviewers at least once by 12/7.
14-- 12/14 – 12/14-- Last Week of Classes||
